Anglin Addon for FFXI

This addon is meant to help out with fishing in FFXI. This was inspired by Thorny's Fishaid addon and is provided at no cost. Please enjoy!

Available commands:

/anglin guide - this will show the fish guide with info on where to find fish and how to catch
/anglin stats - this will show a window that you can view your daily and lifetime stats (daily stats will reset at 12am Japan time)
/anglin settings - this will display the settings window, for now it's only to adjust the transparency of the minigame window.
